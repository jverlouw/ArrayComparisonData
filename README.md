# ArrayComparisonData

This repository contains data accompanying the "A comparison of genotyping arrays" scientific paper, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-021-00917-7. Each file is the compressed bed format of the respective genotyping array's manifest file, which has been processed to be harmonized with UCSC hg19 (lifted over where required) and annotated with dbsnp142 IDs and cadd13 phred-scaled scores using ANNOVAR.
